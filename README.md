# Scholarship API

## This project involved the following frameworks:
* MongoDB
* Express.js
* React.js
* node.js </br></br>


## Functionality:
Users will have access to a scholarship database, they will be able to view the deadlines, award amount, and an overview. They will have search filters and tools to help them narrow down their results. Once a user finds a scholarship they are interested in, they can be redirected to the sponsor's website 
 </br></br></br></br>

#### This project will use a self-made REST api. This was possible using the following node.js dependencies: 
* axios
* cheerio </br>
This allowed me to webscrape the website: (https://collegesofdistinction.com/) </br> I then pushed this data to MongoDB. Which made it easier to store data for POST and GET calls. </br></br></br>


##### Future implementations?
* more search filters
* better UI
* let users create an account for a 'favorites list' of scholarships
